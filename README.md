# odin-recipes
Basic recipes website from an assignment with The Odin Project

This project is meant to showcase the basics of html that I have learned up to this point. This will include the use of html tags like the paragraph, heading, anchor, image, and list tags, to name a few. This implies some sort of file structure being used to be able to link to the different pages and image used for the site.

This website will consist of a main page, index.html and a few other pages containing different recipes.
